# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project

A hands-on SQL project analyzing an **Online Bookstore** database to uncover valuable business insights.
This project works with **three relational tables** — **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders** — and answers **real-world business questions** using MySQL.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate real-world database queries for an e-commerce bookstore.
I used **Basic** and **Advanced** SQL techniques to:

* Retrieve and filter relevant data
* Perform aggregations & joins
* Identify sales trends and customer patterns
* Calculate revenue, stock levels, and bestsellers

## 📂 Dataset & Tables

* **Books** (`Book_ID`, `Title`, `Author`, `Genre`, `Published_Year`, `Price`, `Stock`)
* **Customers** (`Customer_ID`, `Name`, `Country`, `City`)
* **Orders** (`Order_ID`, `Book_ID`, `Customer_ID`, `Quantity`, `Total_Amount`, `Order_Date`)

---

## 🛠 Skills & SQL Concepts Used

* `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` for relational queries
* Aggregations: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
* Filtering by **date ranges** & **numeric thresholds**
* Business-focused query writing
